# CSharpDesktopGame (Catch The Falling Balls)

### The repo contains a simple C# desktop game using OpenTK, created as a mini project for college (Higher Institute for Applied Sciences and Technology - 2022).
##### Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 was used to create this project. Make sure to have an IDE with Microsoft .NET support to make any modifications.

Catch as many balls as you can to get a higher score. The game ends when you hit a block or miss 3 balls. The difficulty increases every time you catch 5 balls.
The game is played using arrows and the space key.
